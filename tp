Since joining the team, my manager has been instrumental in helping me uphold the Firm’s values of excellence and inclusivity. When I was new to Kubernetes and unfamiliar with the numerous components in our bare-bones Kubernetes cluster that we provide to clients, he took the initiative to guide me through the complexities. He not only explained things in a way that I could easily grasp but also set up weekly 1:1 sessions to provide consistent support and check in on my progress. 

Furthermore, he introduced me to a range of platforms and resources that accelerated my learning curve, encouraging me to pursue Kubernetes certifications that would further benefit my career. His proactive support in my learning journey has been invaluable.
